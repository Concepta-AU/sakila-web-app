Sakila Sample Web App
=====================

This project aims to create a sample web application that can be used to test web application test frameworks easily,
in particular: our own [playwright-kotlin](https://github.com/Concepta-AU/playwright-kotlin). The goal is to have a
single Docker image that starts a fully functional web application with enough complexity to make it useful for 
validating a test framework in terms of correctness and design.

It is based on the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) in its 
[PostgreSQL version](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila).
