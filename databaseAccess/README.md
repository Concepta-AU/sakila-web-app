Database Access Layer
=====================

This is a database access layer generated by the JOOQ tooling. See [this tutorial](https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.20/manual/getting-started/tutorials/jooq-in-7-steps/jooq-in-7-steps-step3/)
for details on how the code generation works.

The code here is used only on the server, but kept separate to make sure generated and manual code do not get mixed. If
additional manual code is required, it should be written in the `server` module instead of this one.

The following command was used to create the currently checked in code:

```shell
java -classpath jooq-3.20.7.jar:\
jooq-meta-3.20.7.jar:\
jooq-codegen-3.20.7.jar:\
reactive-streams-1.0.3.jar:\
r2dbc-spi-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar:\
jakarta.xml.bind-api-3.0.0.jar:\
postgresql-42.7.8.jar:. \
org.jooq.codegen.GenerationTool library.xml
```

To refresh the code, a similar command should be run, for which the listed JARs need to be placed in this folder.
